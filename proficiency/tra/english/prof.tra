The paradigmatic alchemist's substance, Alchemist's Fire bursts into flames when exposed to air.  The alchemist carefully packs it into a breakable, usually glass, container.  When <PRO_HESHE> throws it, the glass bursts open, and the substance explodes damaging all nearby creatures in a mini explosion.  Alchemists fire does fire damage equal to 2d3 per rank the character has in alchemy (save vs. wands for half damage with a penalty equal to the creator's intelligence bonus).
STATISTICS:

Acid burns, and can cause a lot of damage if left to burn over a period of time.  Like alchemist fire, acid is carefully packed it into a breakable, usually glass, container.  When <PRO_HESHE> throws it, the glass bursts open covering the target with burning acid.  When hit, a target takes 1d4 + the creator's intelligence modifier of acid damage for a number of rounds equal to the number of ranks the crafter has in alchemy.  Each round after the first, the target can save vs. wands to prevent further damage.
