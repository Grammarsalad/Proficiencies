This mod aims to expand the proficiency system in Infinity Engine games, allowing characters to do things like treat injuries and antitoxins with varying degrees of effectiveness.  But this mod does not merely add ‘non-weapon proficiencies’.  This is a top down revision of the proficiency system that allows characters to do things with their weapons previously impossible without specific magical weapons.  Skilled characters can stun enemies with their blunt weapons, cause grievous bleeding wounds with their bladed weapons, and so on. 

## **Proficiency Tables**
Characters must select both weapon proficiencies and non-weapon proficiencies from the same pool.  As such, characters receive many more proficiency points than in vanilla.  While this may seem to be a boon, characters will soon discover that they will have to make hard choices as they level up.

## **Proficiency Descriptions**
Characters can now learn something other than how to fight better.  Characters can spend proficiency points in other proficiencies referred to as Non-Weapon Proficiencies (though often just called “skills”).  Non-Weapon Proficiencies are associated with various attributes, and often that ability influences how effective the character is with the skill.  Skill Attribute are as follows: 


| Ability Score | Bonus |
| :---: | :---: | 
| 16 | +1 or +5% |
| 17 | +2 or +10% |
| 18 | +3 or +15% |
| 19+ | +4 or +20% |

## Non-Weapon Proficiency Descriptions

### **Proficiency Name** (Ability associated with proficiency)
**Requirements**: Proficiencies themselves do not have requirements, but certain uses of a given skill will have requirements.  For example, generally only spellcasters can make use of alchemy to create potions.  

Description text, and outline of Proficiency uses.

**Proficiency Use**
Outlines a particular use of a given proficiency.

### **Alchemy** (Intelligence) 
**Requirements**: Concoct Elixir: Spellcaster or Concoct Elixir HLA

Alchemy involves advanced training in the handling of magical or quasi-magical substances that often have harmful or surprising effects.  
**Craft Alchemical Items**
Given time, magical skill and materials, an alchemist can concoct magical elixirs, which emulate spells. (see the section below on concoct elixir for details).

Even on the road, and without exotic materials, however, they always have a trick—or a bomb—up their sleeve that they can use in a pinch.  Alchemists collect various regents in their travels and can use these regents to create 1 alchemical item per day per rank they have in Alchemy.  These creations are unstable and do not last longer than 8 hours.  Additionally, only characters trained in alchemy can use them. All effects can be avoided or lessened with a save vs. rod/staff/wand, though the save has a penalty equal to the Alchemists’ intelligence bonus.  The items that the alchemist can create, and the number of ranks that are required for creation are as follows:

| Alchemical item | Requirements | Damage | Other |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| Acid, Makeshift | 1 Rank | 1d4+ Int Bonus acid per round (save neg) | Burns for 1 round/rank |
| Alchemist’s Fire, Makeshift | 1 Rank | 2d3 fire/rank 5’ rad (save ½) |  |
| CONTINUE |  |  |  |

_Acid, Makeshift_: Acid burns, and can cause a lot of damage if left to burn over a period of time.  Like alchemist fire, acid is carefully packed it into a breakable, usually glass, container.  When <PRO_HESHE> throws it, the glass bursts open covering the target with burning acid.  When hit, a target takes 1d4 + the creator's intelligence modifier of acid damage for a number of rounds equal to the number of ranks the crafter has in alchemy.  Each round after the first, the target can save vs. wands to prevent further damage.
STATISTICS:

Weight: 1

Special: Only safely usable by characters that have at least 1 rank in Alchemy.

Characters without the required skill level have a 50% chance of spilling some acid on themselves (suffering full damage with no save).

_Alchemist's Fire, Makeshift_: The paradigmatic alchemist's substance, Alchemist's Fire bursts into flames when exposed to air.  The alchemist carefully packs it into a breakable, usually glass, container.  When <PRO_HESHE> throws it, the glass bursts open, and the substance explodes damaging all nearby creatures in a mini explosion.  Alchemists fire does fire damage equal to 2d3 per rank the character has in alchemy (save vs. wands for half damage with a penalty equal to the creator's intelligence bonus).
STATISTICS:
Weight: 1
Special: Only safely usable by characters that have at least 1 rank in Alchemy.
Characters without the required skill level have a 50% chance of spilling some alchemist fine on themselves (suffering full damage with no save).

**Brew Concoction**
Spell casters, and (if special conditions are met) other characters, can use this skill to brew concoctions.  Concoctions are similar to potions in that they are magic liquids that can be used by anybody.  However, drinking them is not generally recommended as they often have explosive properties.  

**Endurance** (Constitution)
**Requirements**: None

Endurance represents training to withstand heavy exertion and physical punishment.  It is probably *the* quintessential proficiency of warriors, though a smattering of other classes can specialize in endurance.  Characters trained in endurance can go farther, faster, and for longer periods than others.  This nonweapon proficiency allows characters to take a ‘break’ to recover hit points and stamina.  In addition, characters receive bonus maximum hit points equal to the number of ranks they possess in Endurance for each of their first five levels.  

**Second Wind**
Upon using this ability, the character takes a moment to catch <PRO_HISHER> breath.  When <PRO_HESHE> does this, <PRO_HESHE> recovers a number of hit points equal to 25% +10% per rank <PRO_HESHE> has in Endurance, plus <PRO_HISHER> constitution modifier to <PRO_HISHER> hit point total.  Additionally, <PRO_HISHER> fatigue level is reset to zero.  At 4 ranks, the character can purge their body of deleterious poisons and at 5 ranks they can purge their body of disease when they use Second Wind if they make a successful save vs. death.  This ability cannot be used in combat unless a character has attained 7 ranks in Endurance.

<PRO_HESHE> can use this ability one time per day.  <PRO_HESHE> can use this ability one additional time per day if <PRO_HESHE> has 3 ranks in Endurance and <PRO_HESHE> can use this ability a third time if <PRO_HESHE> has 6 ranks in Endurance.     

**Bonus Hit Points**
Characters receive a number of bonus hit points equal to the number of ranks they have in Endurance x their level, up to 5th level.  


### **Heal** (Wisdom) 
**Requirement**: Cure Bonus: Ability to cast any Cure spell.  

This skill represents training in the medical arts.  Individuals trained in healing are able to quickly diagnose and treat various injuries and sicknesses, whether caused by blade, poison or disease.  This skill is most commonly taken by clerics and priests.  While they can invoke the power of their faith to heal the sick and wounded, they often also study the more mundane, but natural sciences to heal their flock so they do not bother their deity with lesser illnesses and wounds.  Warriors’ violent occupation also leads them to study the healing arts.  Occasionally, characters from other professions will learn this skill, though they are typically not as skilled in the healing arts as a priest or warrior.  
This skill has a natural synergy with herbalism, and herbalists are able to create more effective remedies if they are trained healers (see the herbalism skill for details).  Conversely, healers trained in herbalism are more effective at treating afflictions.  

**Treat Injury**
The healer can treat the injuries of <PRO_HISHER> allies on the fly.  <PRO_HESHE> heals 5% of targets max hit points, +5% per rank (max 30% at 5 ranks).  Additionally, successfully treated characters will find their healing rate improved (the rate depends upon the number of ranks of the healer; see below).  This ability is not magical, and there is a chance that you cannot help your ally.  The chance that you will succeed with a heal check is equal to 50% +5% per rank, plus your Wisdom Bonus (max 95%).  Whether or not the check was successful, a character will not benefit from further uses of Treat Injury for the rest of the day. The exception is that a character can always potentially be helped by any healer with more skill than a previous healer.

**Effect**: Heals 5% of target's max hit points, +5% per rank.
**Chance of Success**: 50%, +5% per rank, + the healer's wisdom bonus (i.e. <PRO_HISHER> percentage bonus).
**Special**: Accelerated Healing rate:
1 rank: 1 hit point per 16 turns
2 ranks: 1 hit point per 8 turns
3 ranks: 1 hit point per 4 turns
4 ranks: 1 hit point per 2 turns
5 ranks: 1 hit point per turn.

**Treat Affliction**
In their travels, the healer collects various natural medicines that they can use treat any allies that have recently been afflicted with various toxic substances and debilitating magics.  Upon attaining 3 ranks in Heal, <PRO_HESHE> gains the ability to Treat Afflictions.  <PRO_HESHE> can gains a number of uses of this ability equal to <PRO_HISHER> healing ranks per day.

To use Treat Affliction, the heal must make a healing check (see success rate below).  If <PRO_HESHE> succeeds, <PRO_HESHE> removes any poisons, intoxication, blindness or deafness from the target if <PRO_HESHE> has at least 3 ranks in Heal.  If <PROHESHE> has 4 ranks in Heal, <PRO_HESHE> can also remove any disease from the target.  Finally, if <PRO_HESHE> possesses 5 ranks in Heal, <PRO_HESHE> removes any paralysis or hold effect from the target.
  
Treating such afflictions is tricky, however, and the treatment is not always effective.  The chance of success is equal to 20% +5% per rank in healing. Characters trained in herbalism are much more effective at treating afflictions.  They receive a +5% bonus to their check for every rank they have in herbalism.

**Chance of Success**: 20%, +5% per rank in Heal, + 5% per rank in Herbalism.
**Effect**: 
3 Ranks: Treat Intoxication, Poison, Blindness and Deafness.
4 Ranks: Treat Diseases.
5 Ranks: Treat Paralysis and Hold.

**Cure Bonus**
Healers that can also cast cure spells (any spell with the word “cure” in its title, except Cure Disease) are more capable if they are also trained in healing.  Specifically, they cure an additional 2 points of damage for every rank they possess in in Heal.
