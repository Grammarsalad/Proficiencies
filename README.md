This mod aims to expand the proficiency system in Infinity Engine games, allowing characters to do things like treat injuries and antitoxins with varying degrees of effectiveness.  But this mod does not merely add ‘non-weapon proficiencies’.  This is a top down revision of the proficiency system that allows characters to do things with their weapons previously impossible without specific magical weapons.  Skilled characters can stun enemies with their blunt weapons, cause grievous bleeding wounds with their bladed weapons, and so on. 

## **Proficiency Tables**
Characters must select both weapon proficiencies and non-weapon proficiencies from the same pool.  As such, characters receive many more proficiency points than in vanilla.  While this may seem to be a boon, characters will soon discover that they will have to make hard choices as they level up.

## **Proficiency Descriptions**
Characters can now learn something other than how to fight better.  Characters can spend proficiency points in other proficiencies referred to as Non-Weapon Proficiencies (though often just called “skills”).  Non-Weapon Proficiencies are associated with various attributes, and often that ability influences how effective the character is with the skill.  Skill Attribute are as follows: 


| Ability Score | Bonus |
| :---: | :---: | 
| 16 | +1 or +5% |
| 17 | +2 or +10% |
| 18 | +3 or +15% |
| 19+ | +4 or +20% |

### Non-Weapon Proficiency Descriptions
#### **Proficiency Name** (Ability associated with proficiency)
**Requirements**: Proficiencies themselves do not have requirements, but certain uses of a given skill will have requirements.  For example, generally only spellcasters can make use of alchemy to create potions.  

Description text, and outline of Proficiency uses.

**Proficiency Use**
Outlines a particular use of a given proficiency.

#### **Alchemy** (Intelligence) 
**Requirements**: Concoct Elixir: Spellcaster or Concoct Elixir HLA

Alchemy involves advanced training in the handling of magical or quasi-magical substances that often have harmful or surprising effects.  
**Craft Alchemical Items**
Given time, magical skill and materials, an alchemist can concoct magical elixirs, which emulate spells. (see the section below on concoct elixir for details).

Even on the road, and without exotic materials, however, they always have a trick—or a bomb—up their sleeve that they can use in a pinch.  Alchemists collect various regents in their travels and can use these regents to create 1 alchemical item per day per rank they have in Alchemy.  These creations are unstable and do not last longer than 8 hours.  Additionally, only characters trained in alchemy can use them. All effects can be avoided or lessened with a save vs. rod/staff/wand, though the save has a penalty equal to the Alchemists’ intelligence bonus.  The items that the alchemist can create, and the number of ranks that are required for creation are as follows:

| Alchemical item | Requirements | Damage | Other |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| Acid, Makeshift | 1 Rank | 1d4+ Int Bonus acid per round (save neg) | Burns for 1 round/rank |
| Alchemist’s Fire, Makeshift | 1 Rank | 2d3 fire/rank 5’ rad (save ½) |  |
| CONTINUE |  |  |  |

_Acid, Makeshift_: Acid burns, and can cause a lot of damage if left to burn over a period of time.  Like alchemist fire, acid is carefully packed it into a breakable, usually glass, container.  When <PRO_HESHE> throws it, the glass bursts open covering the target with burning acid.  When hit, a target takes 1d4 + the creator's intelligence modifier of acid damage for a number of rounds equal to the number of ranks the crafter has in alchemy.  Each round after the first, the target can save vs. wands to prevent further damage.
STATISTICS:

Weight: 1

Special: Only safely usable by characters that have at least 1 rank in Alchemy.

Characters without the required skill level have a 50% chance of spilling some acid on themselves (suffering full damage with no save).

_Alchemist's Fire, Makeshift_: The paradigmatic alchemist's substance, Alchemist's Fire bursts into flames when exposed to air.  The alchemist carefully packs it into a breakable, usually glass, container.  When <PRO_HESHE> throws it, the glass bursts open, and the substance explodes damaging all nearby creatures in a mini explosion.  Alchemists fire does fire damage equal to 2d3 per rank the character has in alchemy (save vs. wands for half damage with a penalty equal to the creator's intelligence bonus).
STATISTICS:
Weight: 1
Special: Only safely usable by characters that have at least 1 rank in Alchemy.
Characters without the required skill level have a 50% chance of spilling some alchemist fine on themselves (suffering full damage with no save).

#### **Heal** (Wisdom) 
**Requirement**: Cure Bonus: Ability to cast any Cure Wounds or regeneration spell.  

This skill represents training in the medical arts.  Individuals trained in healing are able to quickly diagnose and treat various injuries and sicknesses, whether caused by blade, poison or disease.  This skill is most commonly taken by clerics and priests.  While they can invoke the power of their faith to heal the sick and wounded, they often also study the more mundane, but natural sciences to heal their flock so they do not bother their deity with lesser illnesses and wounds.  Warriors’ violent occupation also leads them to study the healing arts.  Occasionally, characters from other professions will learn this skill, though they are typically not as skilled in the healing arts as a priest or warrior.  
This skill has a natural synergy with herbalism, and herbalists are able to create more effective remedies if they are trained healers (see the herbalism skill for details).  Conversely, healers trained in herbalism are more effective at treating afflictions.  

**Treat Injury**
The healer can treat the injuries of <PRO_HISHER> allies on the fly.  <PRO_HESHE> heals 5% of targets max hit points, +5% per rank.  Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> can heal her Wisdom Modifier (x2).  This ability is not magical, and there is only so much Treat Injury can do.  A given creature will not benefit from further uses of Treat Injury for the rest of the day. The only exception is if a character has 6 or 7 ranks in Heal.  Such a character can use Treat Injury on a given character if they have already been treated by a less skilled healer.
Additionally, characters treated with this skill find their natural healing rate increased (at increasing rates depending on the number of ranks of the healer).
